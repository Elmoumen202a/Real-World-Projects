## Introduction
Understanding the power consumption of electronic devices is essential for managing energy usage effectively. This project provides a straightforward Python script to calculate the power consumption of a lamp, helping users make informed decisions about energy consumption.

## How it Works
The calculation is based on the formula:

Power Consumption (in kilowatt-hours) = (Wattage of Lamp * Time (in hours)) / 1000

The `calculate_power_consumption` function takes the wattage and usage time as inputs, performs the calculation, and returns the power consumption in kilowatt-hours.

## Formula
The formula to calculate power consumption is:

Power Consumption (in kilowatt-hours) = (Wattage of Lamp * Time (in hours)) / 1000

## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lamp-power-consumption-calculator.git
